Easily copies ISOs to USBs



I found that it was a huge ball-ache to copy a Linux iso (or any iso) to usb on Mac and Linux, so I made a script


Instructions
============

None really, just downloads the script and either run 'python /path/to/MacUSB.py' 
or 'chmod +x /path/to/MacUSB.py' then './MacUSB.py'
